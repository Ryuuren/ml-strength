        <p class="content-paragraph">
          We train athletes - professional, collegiate, youth, and anybody that wants to train like
          an athlete. When we speak of training we are talking about speed, strength, power, and
          sports therapy. Our business is aimed at a health conscience adult who wants to move
          beyond the usual local gym.

          <p class="quote">We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at</p>

          ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with gyms opening
          throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area. ML Strength believes fitness comes first and
          keeping fit and improving your health is not just a fad - it's a way of life. Whether your
          goal is weight loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements, having more energy, or
          just looking and feeling better - we're here for you!
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
          We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness
          industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership
          consultants. Our gyms speak for themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that
          word of mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up.
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
          You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure
          whatsoever. With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants hustling you on every
          corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation, no
          pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate.
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
          We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm
          with our valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude!
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
          We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays, weekends & public
          holidays. WE ARE OPEN! Unlike other so called 24:7 gyms, we are staffed all the time. If
          you need a late-night workout, a protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we
          are open for you. Our class times change constantly so check out on the web site for the
          timetable at each of our clubs.
